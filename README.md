Mr. Kidus Asfaw - Solution for #WSD2015 

Many countries have significantly improved the provision of health services to new-born children and their mothers. As a result, maternal and infant mortality rates have been drastically lowered, and children increasingly immunized from diseases like measles. An interesting question arises, however, regarding the future of the generation of children whose lives have been saved by the improving conditions in their countries. How have their countriesâ€™ educational systems managed with the new influx of children into primary schools? In this study, the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) dataset will be used to explore this topic particularly in the case of least developed countries (LDCs).
